# Working on task


# TODO tasks

- encapsulate better how the `canvas` element is got from a `signature` component to use with the `SignaturePad` library
- `warning` component: text about `buyer` and `buy/rent` could be customized for each visit
- check how to avoid JS errors in the console about `SignaturePad` not in `main.bundle.js`. This must be due to that library being included outside of `npm` and `webpack` and staff
